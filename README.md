# Assignment 2 CS203
This is an assignment from the course CS203 in Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at IIT Kanpur.

The assignment is as follows:

Write a python program which takes a random variable X with range having 5
elements (each element can have probability as a multiple of 1/1000). Draw n random samples
from X and compute the sample mean. Repeat this experiment multiple times and plot these
sample means.
You should get a plot closer and closer to bell shape, as n increases.
